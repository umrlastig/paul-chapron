abstract = {The Sociology of the Organized Action studies how social organizations are regularized due to the equilibrium between the power relationships of the social actors within the organizational context. A formalization of this theory allows to draw the power social network of an organization. On the other hand, the Social Network Analysis has developed efficient tools to improve the understanding of the structure and behavior of social network. The paper shows how these tools are fruitfully applied to power networks.}
